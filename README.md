# Mission-Oriented-Performance-Design-of-a-Subsonic-Fighter-Jet-3D-CAD-Sketch-Models
This repository presents the initial sizing and designs of a high-bypass turbofan subsonic fighter jet, engineered to meet client-specific performance requirements and support mission-oriented operational objectives.

Performance requirements:
 - Pilot (1) - 200 lbs
 - Load factor = 7
 - Weapons weight (GAU-8) - 2,000 lbs
 - Ammunition weight - 2,000 lbs
 - Maximum sea level speed = 400 kn
 - Mission range = 450 nmi
 - ROC at sea level 
 - Stall speed = 95 kn
 - Maximum turn rate = 30 deg per sec
 - Takeoff distance = 1,400 ft
 - Landing distance = 1,900 ft

Mission profile:
 1.	Standard WUTO.

 2.	Climb segment to 30,000 ft: conducted at mach 0.5.

 3.	Cruise segment: 400 nmi at 30,000 ft and mach 0.5.

 4.	Penetration segment: 50 nmi at 375 kn in sea level condition.

 5.	Combat segment: 15 minutes at maximum power.

 6.	Weapon discharge: Fire all of the ammunition.

 7.	Climb to altitude: return to 35,000 ft for cruise.

 8.	Return cruise: 35,000 ft at mach 0.5.

 9.	Loiter: 30 minutes at sea level before recovery.
